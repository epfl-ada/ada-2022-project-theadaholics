### Instructions:

When you are done with Homework H1, you will continue to work on the next project milestone. In Milestone P2, together with your team members, you will agree on, and refine, your project proposal. Your first task is to select a project. Even though we provide the datasets for you to use, at this juncture, it is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible given the data (including any additional data you might bring in yourself), and to perform initial analyses.

The goal of this milestone is to intimately acquaint yourself with the data, preprocess it, and complete all the necessary descriptive statistics tasks. We expect you to have a pipeline in place, fully documented in a notebook, and show us that you have clear project goals.

When describing the relevant aspects of the data, and any other datasets you may intend to use, you should in particular show (non-exhaustive list):

That you can handle the data in its size.
That you understand what’s in the data (formats, distributions, missing values, correlations, etc.).
That you considered ways to enrich, filter, transform the data according to your needs.
That you have a reasonable plan and ideas for methods you’re going to use, giving their essential mathematical details in the notebook.
That your plan for analysis and communication is reasonable and sound, potentially discussing alternatives to your choices that you considered but dropped.
We will evaluate this milestone according to how well these steps have been done and documented, the quality of the code and its documentation, the feasibility and critical awareness of the project. We will also evaluate this milestone according to how clear, reasonable, and well thought-through the project idea is. Please use the second milestone to really check with us that everything is in order with your project (idea, feasibility, etc.) before you advance too much with the final Milestone P3! There will be project office hours dedicated to helping you.

You will work in a public GitHub repository dedicated to your project, which can be created by following this link. The repository will automatically be named ada-2022-project-<your_team_name>. By the Milestone P2 deadline, each team should have a single public GitHub repo under the epfl-ada GitHub organization, containing the project proposal and initial analysis code.

## Abstract

Abstract: A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

What makes a movie successful? While this question may seem like a low-hanging fruit, it requires a very holistic approach. A good film should not only make use of the 7th Art but of all seven Arts. A movie implies many choices: what genres to focus on, which director and actors bring the most added value, what budget to spend? With such a big movie database, we can expect to find some patterns for which those choices lead to more successful movies. But then again, what makes a movie successful? From profitability to perenniality, we shall investigate different success indicators and who knows, perhaps draw a generator for the next successful movie.

## Research Questions

Research Questions: A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

- What budget should be invested for a successful film? 
- Which actors and directors brings the most added value to a movie?
- Investigate correlation between the choice of genres and movie profitability. What genres are the most profitable?
- What is the link between an actor's success and his/her physical features (gender, age, height, ethnicity)
- What release months are most profitable? 
- What countries release the most profitable winning movie? Is this evolving with time? 
- What types of roles will be suitable for which actors?
- What are the best plot lines?



## Proposed additional datasets and files

Proposed additional datasets (if any): List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.


## Methods

What budget should be invested per film: Compare gross revenue to budget invested. Make a linear / log regression of gross revenue as a function of  budget invested, and other numerical features we have which affect success.
Gross revenue VS Actors & directors choice:  By comparing film investment to the cast, one can also look into which actors and directors bring the most added value to a movie. Cross-reference between actors and their movie ratings
correlation between the choice of topics and movie profitability can be investigated
Check link between actors success as a function of their physical features
What types of roles will be suitable for which actors
What genres are the most profitable?
What release months/period are most profitable, oscar winning ? 
What countries release the most oscar winning movie? Is this evolving with time? 
What are the best plot lines? (NLP?)



## Proposed timeline

## Organisation within the team
Organization within the team: A list of internal milestones up until project Milestone P3.

## Questions for the TAs

Questions for TAs (optional): Add here any questions you have for us related to the proposed project.
Notebook containing initial analyses and data handling pipelines. We will grade the correctness, quality of code, and quality of textual descriptions.
